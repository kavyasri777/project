        <h3>Biodegradable</h3>
        <p>Biodegradable wastes are such waste materials which are and can be degraded by natural factors like microbes and abiotic elements like temperature, UV, oxygen, etc. Some examples of such wastes are food materials, kitchen wastes, and other natural wastes. Microorganisms and other abiotic factors together break down complex substances into simpler organic matter, which eventually suspend and fade into the soil.</p>

        <h3>Non-degradable</h3>
        <p>Non-degradable substances are materials that cannot be broken down by natural organisms and remain in the environment for thousands of years. They are a source of pollution and can harm human life and other organisms. 
            Some examples of non-degradable substances include
            plastics, lead, metals, chemicals, rubber, paints, and batteries. 
            Non-degradable substances can cause air, water, and soil pollution, and diseases like cancer. To remove them from the environment, a combination of biological and physicochemical methods are required</p>
